this project is a website to store student academic record. the website will be called PortofolioSiswa.
Im planning to use next js, supabase for database and authentication, and will deploy the web on vercel latter on.

this will be the project structure.
1. home page : this will be the starting page for the web. it tells waht is the whole website is about. there will be a night/day modee theme toggle on the navbar above. id like the design to be simple use cursor website as reference if possible.

2. login page: the login functionaly will solely used supabase. i also want to use google account as login option.

3. after login user will be redirected to homepage/dashboard: will keep this empty for now. but theres a navbar that diffrent from the one in the home page. there's a link to go to portofolio page, insert data page and setting page.

the nav nav bar layout on mobile device will be positioned at the bottom, just like a mobile apps. 

4. portofolio page will display the student academic record. it will display the overall mark average using circle diagram at the top beside the users identity. below that is the academic record using table.

5. insert data page is just a form page, i still can't decide if i should use a whole page or just a modal for it.
