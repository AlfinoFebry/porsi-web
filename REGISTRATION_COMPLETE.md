## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User creates account (Supabase Auth)
2. User selects type (siswa/alumni) 
3. User fills biodata form (stored in `profiles` table)
4. User inputs academic records (stored in `academic_records` table)
5. Additional subjects stored in `additional_subjects` table

### Database Schema
```sql
profiles:
- id (UUID, references auth.users)
- Basic info: name, date_of_birth, gender, user_type
- Student info: nama_sekolah, jurusan, class
- Alumni info: nama_perguruan_tinggi, tahun_lulus_sma, etc.

academic_records:
- user_id, subject, semester (1-4), score (0-100)
- Unique constraint on (user_id, subject, semester)

additional_subjects:
- user_id, subject_name, subject_category
```

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Proper authentication checks
- Input validation and sanitization

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- Execute: supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Ensure these variables are set in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Dependencies
All required dependencies are already installed:
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `clsx` - Conditional classes
- `tailwind-merge` - Class merging

### 4. Access Registration
Navigate to `/register` or click the "Register" button in the navigation.

## üîß Testing the System

### Test Scenarios
1. **Siswa SMA - Class 10 (IPA)**
   - Should show only semester 1 inputs
   - Should show IPA subjects + option for IPS subjects

2. **Siswa SMA - Class 11/12 (IPS)**
   - Should show semesters 1-4 inputs
   - Should show IPS subjects + option for IPA subjects

3. **Alumni**
   - Should show semesters 1-4 inputs
   - Should show both IPA and IPS subjects
   - Should have university-related fields in biodata

### OCR Testing
1. Upload a clear photo of a student report
2. Check that API call is made to https://api.porsi.me
3. Verify OCR text result is displayed
4. Manual score entry should always work as fallback
